# Seaborn Learning (Basic Exposure)

This repository contains my foundational exposure to Seaborn for statistical data visualization.

The goal was not to master advanced styling or every plot type, but to understand:

- How Seaborn works with pandas DataFrames
- How to use `x`, `y`, and `data` parameters properly
- How to choose appropriate plots based on data types
- How to compare numeric distributions across categories

In this repository, I explored:
- Boxplots (categorical vs numeric comparison)
- Violin plots (distribution visualization)

Further depth in Seaborn is intentionally postponed to focus on core machine learning concepts.
